# Sentinel from Scratch

In this training session we will cover the Sentinel language specification by building an example policy from scratch.

## Policy Basics

### 01 - Main

This exercise explains the use of main and introduces the student to a very simple policy evaluation.

### 02 - Rules

This exercise builds on the previous but we introduce the concept of rules and how they pertain to the process of writing policies that are easy to read. It also introduces the student to the `when` predicate and how these can be used to control rule evaluation.

### 03 - Variables & Values

Introduces the student to variable declaration and how to use the `print` function to view values assigned to a given variable.

### 04 - Imports & Parameters

Builds on the previous example where the variable declaration is replaced with a parameterised value. This exercise introduces the concept of imports and how one can use the `types` import in conjunction with the `print` function to parse a parameter object's type.

### 05 - Operators & Delimiters

In previous exercises all rules have used the `print` function to view values which always evaluates to `true` with the context of rule evaluation. In this exercise we introduce the concept of operators to test for equality etc.

### 06 - Collections

Introduces collections in the form of a MAP and LIST. In this exercise we start to take some of the concepts that we have learnt in previous exercises and apply them to define our first usable policy.

### 07 - Quantifier Expressions

In this exercise we introduce the student to the use of ANY, ALL and Filter expressions.

### 08 - Functions & Modules

In this exercise we introduce the HTTP import and write a function that pulls JSON data from a web based API. The function will form the basis of a discussion around encouraging code reuse by packaging up functions in modules.

### 09 - Debugging
